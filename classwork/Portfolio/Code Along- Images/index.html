                        <h2> <em>About Me</em></h2>
                            <p> I am an aspiring Developer. Here is a little bit about me.
                                 <strong>Just a little.</strong> I have always loved traveling and adventures. So far I have only visited Nepal, India, Canada and the USA but it is one of my dreams to visit atleast one country from each continent as well as the 7 wonders of the world. My recent traveling adventure was a cross country trip from the West coast to the East.</p>
            
                            <p> I have a cat and two little chubby budgies. If you do not know much about Budgies. They are a kind of Parrot. One of them is a male with very soft yellow feathers and the other one is a female albino.

                            <p> Some day I wish to travel around the world, solo. I think it is important to learn to enjoy our own company. When you travel, you learn alot about the world and about yourself. Some times it is important to take a break from the world and reset yourself through learning different cultures, traditions and languages.
                            </p>

                            <p> In order to balance my work and life, I practice Meditation. I meditate on the daily basis. Some days, I focus on my concentration, somedays I meditate to just breathe conciously. One thing I struggle during my meditation is getting rid of thoughts that are not constructive to my wellbeing. I hope to make this part of my lifestyle.</p>
